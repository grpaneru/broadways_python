# operators are special symbol in any programming laguage to carry out arithemtic and logical operations
a=1
b=2
c=a+b
# "=" is an assignment operatot and "+" is an arithemetic operator
#arithemtic operator
# addition +
subtraction -
#multipliction *
#division /
#floor division // floor division removes the decimal and provides the integer neaar to floor
#Exponent 3**2 =9
#moduluds % gives remainsder  5%4 gives 1


# Compariion operators/ relation operator
# equal  ==
#!=  not equal



## logical Operators
# and, or, not are the logical operations

# the results in logical operations  are tru or false

# identity operator: It check the whether the two objects are same or not it is used for the ideitiy check
# "is'  or "is not"
a=1
b=2
print(a is b) #true
print(id(a))# for the sam object, id() gives equal value

# membership operator
# it is used to check membership of an object in a sequence
print(2 in [1,2,3]) # true
print(3 not in [1,2,3] #false)
# in and not in  used in membership

# Assignment operator: the resullt of any operation can be assigned to a variable using an assignmne
#operrator "=" is  a basic assigmnent  operator.
name="jon" #here = is an assignmnet operator
# +=, -=,  *=, /=  are asiignment operators
a=1
a=a+1 #this line can be written as  a+==
# precedent and associativity
# precedent of the opertaot is the rule that determines which operator should be excuted first
# if multiple operators in an operatios have the same the precedent then the associativity
# determine the operation sequencs
# normally associativity is from left to right except for the case of **
# for exponent (**) it is from right left)
